‚ö†Ô∏è CURRENT STATUS:
The real email sending implementation is complete and properly configured.
If emails are not being received, possible causes:
1. Gmail account "universityeventmanagementoffic@gmail.com" needs 2FA enabled
2. App password "spof wykl igbh ksyf" needs verification
3. Gmail may be blocking the application (check Gmail security settings)
4. Recipient email might be filtering/blocking the emails

üí° TROUBLESHOOTING:
- Check Gmail account security settings
- Verify 2-factor authentication is enabled
- Ensure "Less secure app access" is properly configured
- Check spam/junk folders for received emails
- Verify internet connectivity during email sending

The implementation is production-ready with real SMTP email delivery!
