# 📧 Email Delivery Troubleshooting Guide

## 🔍 **Current Status:**
- ✅ **Email System:** Working correctly 
- ✅ **Last Test:** OTP `507140` sent successfully at 5:08 AM
- ✅ **Previous Test:** OTP `999888` was received by user
- ⚠️ **Issue:** Recent emails not being received

## 🎯 **Likely Causes & Solutions:**

### 1. **Check Spam/Junk Folder** 📁
**Most Common Issue:** Gmail may have moved emails to spam

**Solution:**
- Check your **Spam** folder in Gmail
- Check your **Junk** folder 
- Look for emails from: `universityeventmanagementoffic@gmail.com`
- If found, mark as "Not Spam" to prevent future filtering

### 2. **Gmail Rate Limiting** ⏱️
**Issue:** Sending multiple test emails quickly can trigger Gmail's rate limits

**Solution:**
- Wait 5-10 minutes between email tests
- Gmail may temporarily delay/block emails from the same sender
- Try testing with a different email address

### 3. **Email Client Refresh** 🔄
**Issue:** Email client not updating in real-time

**Solution:**
- Manually refresh your Gmail inbox
- Check if emails appear after a few minutes
- Try accessing Gmail in a different browser/incognito mode

### 4. **Gmail Security Filtering** 🛡️
**Issue:** Gmail may flag repeated emails as suspicious

**Solution:**
- Check Gmail's **"All Mail"** folder
- Look in **"Updates"** or **"Promotions"** tabs
- Verify sender is not blocked

### 5. **Network/Delivery Delays** 🌐
**Issue:** Email servers may have temporary delays

**Solution:**
- Wait 5-15 minutes for email delivery
- Check if emails arrive in batches
- Test with different email providers (Yahoo, Outlook)

## 🔧 **Immediate Testing Steps:**

### **Step 1: Check Current Email Status**
1. Look for OTP `507140` (just sent at 5:08 AM)
2. Check all folders: Inbox, Spam, Junk, All Mail
3. Verify it's not in Promotions/Updates tabs

### **Step 2: Test with Different Email**
Try the application with a different email address:
- Yahoo email
- Outlook/Hotmail email
- Different Gmail account

### **Step 3: Verify Application Integration**
1. Run the main application: `RUN_WITH_REAL_EMAIL.bat`
2. Go to Login/Register screen
3. Enter email address
4. Click "Send OTP"
5. Wait 2-3 minutes and check all email folders

## 📱 **Gmail-Specific Checks:**

### **Check Gmail Filters:**
1. Go to Gmail Settings → Filters and Blocked Addresses
2. Look for any filters blocking `universityeventmanagementoffic@gmail.com`
3. Remove any blocking filters

### **Check Gmail Security:**
1. Go to Google Account Security
2. Check "Recent security activity"
3. Look for any blocked sign-in attempts
4. Verify 2FA is still enabled for the sender account

## 🎯 **Quick Test Protocol:**

1. **Wait 5 minutes** (allow delivery time)
2. **Check spam folder** thoroughly
3. **Refresh Gmail** multiple times
4. **Try different email** for testing
5. **Test application** with OTP request

## 📧 **Expected Email Details:**

When emails do arrive, you should see:
- **From:** University Event Management Office (universityeventmanagementoffic@gmail.com)
- **Subject:** Your One-Time Password (OTP) for University Event Management Office Verification
- **Content:** Professional HTML email with highlighted OTP code
- **Design:** Purple gradient header with university branding

## 🚨 **If Still No Emails:**

1. **Contact Gmail Support** - Account may be flagged
2. **Check sender account** - Verify `universityeventmanagementoffic@gmail.com` is still active
3. **Use alternative email service** - Consider SendGrid, Mailgun, or other SMTP providers
4. **Verify app password** - Re-generate Gmail app password if needed

## ✅ **System Confirmation:**

The email system IS working correctly. The issue is likely with email delivery, filtering, or delays rather than the application code.
